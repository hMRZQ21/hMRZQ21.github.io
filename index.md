## About

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building clean, user‑friendly products and solving data‑heavy problems.

- What I’m into: web apps, data, automation, and thoughtful UI.
- Fun fact: I like building PCs and playing with Raspberry Pi’s. I enjoy cooking, gaming (streaming too), and working out.
